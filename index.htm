	   <p>I know HTML quite a bit but i hope to learn the newer stuff specially features added to HTML 5. I also hope to get more on CSS and Javascript. I've worked with them--but not from scratch, i always find pre-made solutions and tweak them. I hope to increase my knowledge on CSS and JAVASCRIPT. I hope i could keep up with this class.</p>
	   <p>I'm probably intermediate...LOL</p>
